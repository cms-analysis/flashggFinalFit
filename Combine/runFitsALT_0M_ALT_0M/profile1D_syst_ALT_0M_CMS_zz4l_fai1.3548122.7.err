WARNING: You are trying to use SCRAM architecture 'slc7' on host with operating system 'el9'.
         This is not supported and likely will not work and you might get build/runtime errors. Please either
         - use correct SCRAM_ARCH to match your host's operating system.
         - OR use 'cmssw-el7' script to start a singularity container (http://cms-sw.github.io/singularity.html)
         - OR use host which has 'slc7' installed e.g. lxplus8 for el8, lxplus9 for el9 or lxplus7 for slc7.
ModelConfig 'ModelConfig' defines more than one parameter of interest. This is not supported in some statistical methods.
